React Native Network Info API for Android, iOS & Windows. It allows you to get information on:

* Connection type
* Connection quality

## Getting started
Install the library using either Yarn:

```
yarn add @react-native-community/netinfo
```

or npm:

```
npm install --save @react-native-community/netinfo
```

You then need to link the native parts of the library for the platforms you are using. The easiest way to link the library is using the CLI tool by running this command from the root of your project:

```
react-native link @react-native-community/netinfo
```

If you can't or don't want to use the CLI tool, you can also manually link the library using the instructions below (click on the arrow to show them):

<details>
<summary>Manually link the library on iOS</summary>

Either follow the [instructions in the React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios#manual-linking) to manually link the framework or link using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) by adding this to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'react-native-netinfo', :path => '../node_modules/@react-native-community/netinfo'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Manually link the library on Android</summary>

Make the following changes:

#### `android/settings.gradle`
```groovy
include ':react-native-community-netinfo'
project(':react-native-community-netinfo').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@react-native-community/netinfo/android')
```

#### `android/app/build.gradle`
```groovy
dependencies {
   ...
   implementation project(':react-native-community-netinfo')
}
```

#### `android/app/src/main/.../MainApplication.java`
On top, where imports are:

```java
import com.reactnativecommunity.netinfo.NetInfoPackage;
```

Add the `NetInfoPackage` class to your list of exported packages.

```java
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
            new NetInfoPackage()
    );
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Manually link the library on Windows</summary>

* Open the solution in Visual Studio for your Windows apps
* Right click in the Explorer and click Add > Existing Project...
* Navigate to `./<app-name>/node_modules/@react-native-community/netinfo/windows/RNCNetInfo/` and add `RNCNetInfo.csproj`
* This time right click on your React Native Windows app under your solutions directory and click Add > Reference...
* Check the `RNCNetInfo` you just added and press ok
* Open up `MainReactNativeHost.cs` for your app and edit the file like so:

```diff
+ using ReactNativeCommunity.NetInfo;
......
        protected override List<IReactPackage> Packages => new List<IReactPackage>
        {
            new MainReactPackage(),
+           new RNCNetInfoPackage(),
        };
```

</details>

## Migrating from the core `react-native` module
This module was created when the NetInfo was split out from the core of React Native. To migrate to this module you need to follow the installation instructions above and then change you imports from:

```javascript
import { NetInfo } from "react-native";
```

to:

```javascript
import NetInfo from "@react-native-community/netinfo";
```

Note that the API was updated after it was extracted from NetInfo to support some new features, however, the previous API is still available and works with no updates to your code.

## Usage
Import the library:

```javascript
import NetInfo from "@react-native-community/netinfo";
```

Get the network state once:

```javascript
NetInfo.fetch().then(state => {
  console.log("Connection type", state.type);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});
```

Subscribe to network state updates:

```javascript
// Subscribe
const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  console.log("Connection type", state.type);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```

### Types

#### `NetInfoState`
Describes the current state of the network. It is an object with these properties:

| Property        | Type                                             | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`          | [`NetInfoStateType`](#netinfostatetype)          | The type of the current connection.                                                                |
| `isConnected`   | `boolean`                                        | If there is an active network connection. Note that this DOES NOT mean that internet is reachable. |
| `details`       |                                                  | The value depends on the `type` value. See below.                                                  |

The `details` value depends on the `type` value.

##### `type` is `none` or `unknown`

`details` is `null`.

##### `type` is `wifi`, `bluetooth`, `ethernet`, `wimax`, `vpn`, or `other`

`details` has these properties:

| Property                | Type      | Description                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `isConnectionExpensive` | `boolean` | If the network connection is considered "expensive". This could be in either energy or monetary terms. |

##### `type` is `cellular`

`details` has these properties:

| Property                | Type                                                               | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isConnectionExpensive` | `boolean`                                                          | If the network connection is considered "expensive". This could be in either energy or monetary terms.                |
| `cellularGeneration`    | [`NetInfoCellularGeneration`](#netinfocellulargeneration)          | The generation of the cell network the user is connected to. This can give an indication of speed, but no guarantees. |

#### `NetInfoStateType`
Describes the current type of network connection. It is an enum with these possible values:

| Value       | Platform              | Description                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

### Methods

#### `fetch()`

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to a [`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate) object.

**Example:**
```javascript
NetInfo.fetch().then(state => {
  console.log("Connection type", state.type);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});
```

#### `addEventListener()`

Subscribe to connection information. The callback is called with a parameter of type [`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate) whenever the connection state changes. Your listener will be called with the latest information soon after you subscribe and then with any subsequent changes afterwards. You should not assume that the listener is called in the same way across devices or platforms.

| Parameter   | Type                                                          | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listener`  | `(state: `[`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate))` => void` | The listener which will be called whenever the connection state changes |

**Example:**
```javascript
// Subscribe
const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  console.log("Connection type", state.type);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```

#### `useNetInfo()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) which can be used to get access to the latest state. It returns a hook with the [`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate) type.

**Example:**
```jsx
import {useNetInfo} from "@react-native-community/netinfo";

const YourComplement = () => {
  const netInfo = useNetInfo();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Type: {netInfo.type}</Text>
      <Text>Is Connected? {netInfo.isConnected}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Errors while running Jest tests

If you do not have a Jest Setup file configured, you should add the following to your Jest settings and create the `jest.setup.js` file in project root:

```js
setupFiles: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js']
```

You should then add the following to your Jest setup file to mock the NetInfo Native Module:

```js
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

NativeModules.RNCNetInfo = {
  getCurrentState: jest.fn(),
  addListener: jest.fn(),
  removeListeners: jest.fn()
};
```

### Issues with the iOS simulator

There is a [known](http://openradar.appspot.com/14585459) [issue](http://www.openradar.appspot.com/29913522) with the iOS Simulator which causes it to not receive network change notifications correctly when the host machine disconnects and then connects to Wifi. If you are having issues with iOS then please test on an actual device before reporting any bugs.
