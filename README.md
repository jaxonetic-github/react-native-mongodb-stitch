** Test Cases
 Testcases can be found in __tests__. There are examples of unit tests, integration tests.  At the moment there are unit and e2e tests with Jest and Detox. [https://github.com/wix/Detox]


** This app uses KEYS and ID's from Google and StreetySmarts.  They are stored securely (I hope) as Secrets and accessed via Stitch Functions which are similar to AWS Lambdas.
